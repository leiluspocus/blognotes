I was following this well-written <a href="http://wiki.gumstix.org/index.php?title=Eclipse_on_Gumstix_for_new_users" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to set up eclipse for my gumstix when I came to the part Â«Â Connect your gumstixÂ Â» (with the Eclipse Terminal). Before setting up the terminal connection on Eclipse, make sure that Eclipse will have the permissions to access to the folder. I didn&rsquo;t have the permissions and I had the error Â«Â /dev/ttyUSB0: No such folder errorÂ Â» even if my board was plugged.
  
A simple **chmod** on the folder resolves the issue. Make also sure that you have an UTF-8 encoding, otherwise you gonna have a bad time while reading what&rsquo;s going on on your board ! ðŸ˜€
